However, purchasing the parts required for the build is not as simple as walking into a store and be able to buy everything you need in a single cardboard box.\r\n\r\n# Where to buy parts from?\r\n\r\nBeing in Singapore, there are not many places to choose from to buy the parts from. However, this simplifies the process of finding out where has the best prices.\r\n\r\n## Physical stores\r\n\r\nThe best physical place to get components for your new build would be **[Sim Lim Square](https://simlimsquare.com.sg/) (SLS)**. \r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3988.7865647417907!2d103.8507321147539!3d1.303043299049612!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x31da19bbd63d9707%3A0xc74a2b4c417f7f3d!2sSim%20Lim%20Square!5e0!3m2!1sen!2ssg!4v1610792742170!5m2!1sen!2ssg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" aria-hidden=\"false\" tabindex=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nLocated at **1 Rochor Canal Road, Singapore 188504**, SLS is a large retail complex in Singapore that offers a wide variety of electronic goods and services ranging from DVDs, cameras, phones, video cameras, and computer parts and servicing.\r\n\r\nWith 7 levels of shopping and over 150 individual stores, SLS can appear intimidating at first but when you're actually there, you can see that the levels of the mall are actually segregated into their own fields, and **most of the shops selling computer parts are located on the 3rd to 5th floor**.\r\n\r\nHere comes the hard part: go to a couple of stores selling PC parts, usually at the front of the store, they will have their pricelists printed on paper that you can take. You don't have to do this for too many stores, maybe just do it for around 5 stores so you can compare prices and get a good average. If you're familiar with SLS and its stores, you can just choose the bigger names in this industry. If you want an easier and more eco-friendly approach, the more popular stores will have their price lists on their websites or social media so you won't even have to make a trip down to SLS to compare prices. \r\n\r\nIn my most recent build, I have seen **price differences of about a total of $50 between stores**.\r\n\r\nThe best part of buying the parts from a physical store would be the service. Unsure if your parts are compatible with each other? Need recommendations? Just ask the sales staff.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, most stores also have a **building service** where they can help you build the system for you using the parts you have chosen. However, this would incur a build fee of a few tens of dollars and would most likely require you to have to purchase all the parts from that store.  \r\n\r\n## Online stores\r\n\r\nUnlike shopping offline, customers are unable to physically view the merchandise and even ask questions to sales staff. This means that you would have to do all the research yourself when it comes to choosing the parts. \r\n\r\nWith the local big-name e-commerce sites such as Lazada and Shopee, you're able to find some good deals. However, prices on those websites are still quite similar to those you can find locally, although a bit better with promos and discounts.\r\n\r\nThe goldmine here would be Amazon Singapore. Here, you're able to buy components from Singapore as well as other countries such as the USA. This means that pricing on the website would have to be competitive globally. Usually, when buying from overseas, the main concern would be shipping costs and returns policy. With an Amazon Prime subscription of $2.99 a month (as of Jan 2021), you're able to get **free shipping** on most items. Additionally, Amazon has an amazing **returns policy** where you can return any items within two weeks of receiving them. The only downside would be a longer delivery time.\r\n\r\nIn my most recent build, when looking at the prices online, some parts such as memory and storage are a lot cheaper, but other parts such as cases and power supplies are much more expensive. However, when buying from both physical stores and online stores (mostly Amazon), I've seen a **huge price difference of around 15%**,which amounted to $200,as compared to only buying from physical stores. \r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\n\r\nIf you want the best prices for your new build, you're going to have to put in some effort. If you know what parts you want and just want the parts to come to you, purchase them online. If you're unsure of what parts to get or just want to do some physical shopping, head down to SLS. However, if you want the best prices, you're going to have to combine both methods."},{"id":"2021-01-14-lorem-ipsum","sort":1610604360,"title":"Lorem Ipsum\r","author":"Raynold Tan\r","date":"January 14, 2021","time":"14:06","content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
